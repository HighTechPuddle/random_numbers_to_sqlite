Using the random python module we generate some random numbers and then save them to a sqlite database. We save it to a database because python file handling fucking sucks, if we tried to save it to a .txt file we wouldnt have enough memory after a while. With the database we can basically save as many numbers as we want.

I just wanted to see how random it actually is and I can say it is pretty random, with the visualization to 2D and 3D, it always covered the whole thing.
